h1. NAME

lddsafe -- Safely print shared library dependencies (similar to ldd)

h1. SYNOPSIS

lddsafe [-n] [-q] FILE ...

h1. DESCRIPTION

@lddsafe@ is a shell script written for Linux distributions (tested under Slackware Linux) that prints shared library dependencies for executable files and shared libraries, similar to @ldd@. However, it uses @objdump@ instead of loading the program, hence avoiding the security problems of @ldd@.

h1. OPTIONS

-n Nonrecursive mode. List direct dependencies only.

-q Quiet mode. Only list the resolved library paths.

h1. REQUIREMENTS

The most notable requirement of @lddsafe@ is that it needs @bash@ version 4 or later.

h1. BUG REPORTS

Please, do not hesitate to use the issue tracker to point out possible improvements and ways to make the script work on systems which it currently may not work on.
